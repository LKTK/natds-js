# 7. 100% coverage in integration tests

Date: 2019-09-24

## Status

Proposed

## Context

To ensure code quality we should have 100% coverage for integration tests.

## Decision

A component will only be completed when coverage is 100% for unit integration.

## Consequences

Higher quality and security of the codebase.
Longer development time in the short term.
Need to maintain a test platform for Native and another for Web.
