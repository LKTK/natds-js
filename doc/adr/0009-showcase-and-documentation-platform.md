# 9. Showcase and documentation platform

Date: 2019-09-24

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Future Design System consumers need to conveniently locate and interact with components to efficiently find what they need.
We must also have documentation of what each component does and what its correct application is.

## Decision

We will create a component display and documentation platform, something similar to Shopify's Polaris and Material-UI.

## Consequences

Convenience for the Design System consumer when looking for a component and greater certainty that you will have a rewarding experience using it.
Additional difficulty creating and maintaining a separate structure.
