# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change,
but the list belows should give some indication of our plans for the next releases and for the future.

## Priorities

1. **Better DX**: remove any errors and warnings when installing or using libraries that generate friction in the developer experience;
2. **Better integration**: validate and integrate contributions from components and icons of contributors;
3. **Better Storybook**: improve Storybook performance and current components documentation;
4. **Better icons**: migrate `<Icon />` strategy to use SVG instead of current icon font (adding alias and keeping a font icon alternative);
5. **Better MFe compatibility**: ensure that Design System libraries will work fine with [`LitElement`](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-element-starter-ts/), `single-spa` (WebFV) and TypeScript;
6. **Better styling strategy**: gradually adopt JSS-based Material UI instead of current `styled-components`;
7. **Better autocompletion experience**: gradually add `prop-types` for all components for better developer experience;
8. **Better snapshot testing**: gradually adopt `react-test-renderer` instead of current `enzyme` for snapshot testing;
9. **Better code examples**: mantain boilerplates and code snippets showing how implement Design System in web projects.
