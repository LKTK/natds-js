# 3. TypeScript Usage

Date: 2019-09-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to make sure our code is consistent and typo proof.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript to ensure static analysis of types.

## Consequences

We will be assured that our types will be correct and consistent.
We will have a longer learning curve and consequently a longer time to run the first components.
This time is likely to decrease as we become more familiar with the TypeScript.
