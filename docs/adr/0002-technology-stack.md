Accepted

## Context

Build a component library in accordance with the Design System created by Natura's UX team to ensure code consistency and reuse across the various Natura systems.
The technologies used in Natura's systems are React for web applications and React Native for Android and iOS applications.
We must create the components for both platforms, web and native.

## Decision

React and React Native will be used to develop the component library.

## Consequences

We will enable the use of components by web and native applications.
Possibility of having very similar components, with only the end result differing.
